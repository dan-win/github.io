<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

Protecting your personal details on our website.
<p>

<p>

We provide a platform (the “<b>Platform</b>”) via the Website for lending and borrowing transactions conducted between our customers. This policy sets out the basis on which any information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us, and how we use it in the operation of the Platform. By visiting www.guarantormyloan.co.uk (the “<b>Website</b>”) you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this policy.

<h4>5.    Automated decisions – your rights</h4>
<p>

5.1.    We may use a credit-scoring system, i.e. an automated system to assess any aspect of your credit worthiness and decide whether to admit you to the Platform. You may ask us to ensure that, when we are evaluating your application for finance or to become a lender, we don’t base any decisions solely on an automated process. You must notify us of this request in writing.
<p>
5.2.    If you make such a request, you will then have the right to be notified where such a decision is or will be based on an automated process. If we notify you that we have taken such a decision, you may request us to review that decision other than by automatic means by writing to us within 21 days of receiving the notification. 
<p>

<h4>6.    Security measures</h4>
<p>

6.1.    We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.

<p>

<h4>7.    The internet</h4>
<p>

When you first give us information through the Website, we will normally give you the opportunity to say whether you would prefer us not to contact you by email. You can also always send us an email (at the address set out below) at any time if you change your mind. 
<p>
7.2.    Please remember that communications over the internet, such as emails and webmails (messages sent through a website), are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may go through a number of countries before they are delivered - this is the nature of the internet. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Website: any transmission is at your own risk.
<p>
<h4>8.    Cookies </h4>
<p>
8.1.    When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. In order to improve the Website we may place small amounts of information on your computer. These are called 'cookies'. A cookie is a small amount of data which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone (referred to in this policy as a ‘device’) from the Website and is stored on your device’s hard drive.
<p>
8.2.    A cookie records on your device information relating to your internet activity (such as whether you have visited the Website before). The cookies we use on the Website won't collect personally identifiable information about you and we won't disclose information stored in cookies that we place on your device to third parties.
<p>
8.3.    If you don't want us to use cookies when you use the Website, you can adjust your internet browser settings not to accept cookies. Your web browser's help function should tell you how to do this. Alternatively, to find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit the website: http://www.allaboutcookies.org. This website will also explain how you can delete cookies which are already stored on your device. In addition, visit www.google.co.uk/goodtoknow/data-on-the-web/cookies for a video about cookies. 
<p>
8.4.    The cookies used on the Website have been categorised based on the categories found in the ICC UK Cookie guide, as follows:
<p>

Category 1: Strictly necessary cookies
<p>

These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.
<p>

Category 2: Performance cookies
<p>

These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a website works.
<p>

Category 3: Functionality cookies 
<p>

These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, a website may be able to provide you with local weather reports or traffic news by storing in a cookie the region in which you are currently located. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as a live chat session. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
<p>

Category 4: Targeting cookies or advertising cookies 
<p>

These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.
